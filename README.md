# MEMOIRS

## The idea behind this project

This project developed from the idea of using the publicly posted notes from [memos](https://usememos.com) as the basis for a personal blog website.

The use of the [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev) standard supports the expansion of the memos Markdown content with additional dynamic elements based on the [Astro](https://astro.build) web framework.

For testing purposes, you can use the "Admin" button to change the Memos server that is to serve as the note source.

Features:

- ✅ Shares your _public_ notes and thoughts from [memos](https://usememos.com/)
- ✅ SEO-friendly by delivering static contents
- ✅ Ships zero JavaScript to the client
- ✅ Adds [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) support to your memo notes
- ✅ Supports the development and use of your own components
- ✅ Uses [Astro](https://astro.build) with SSR as the backend framework
